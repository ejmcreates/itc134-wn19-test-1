This is an angest fest with a strong theme of how people can't beat the odds. The story is about an unathletic bard 
who is constantly annoying a committed circuit priestess. It takes place in an underground university in Paris. The story begins 
with someone reading a book, climaxes with the discovery of a lost item, and ends with time travel. A rebellion against 
technology plays a major role in this story.

Occasionally a talking chocolate Pikachu enters the story to liven things up a bit.
